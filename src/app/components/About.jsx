            Hi there! My name is Isabelle Kwan and I am a second year student studying computing science at Simon Fraser University!
            I am particularly interested in visual computing, but I am always open to learning and exploring different topics in technology.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Aside from that, some personal interests of mine include dance, fashion, graphic design, and video games
            (My personal favourites are Animal Crossing and Unpacking). As well, I love making vlogs for my YouTube channel
            which you can find here! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC11O9tOQoa0FszZdmI4oAKw </p>
